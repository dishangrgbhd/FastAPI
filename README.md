#Practicing deploying AI into production using FASTAPIs 

#UPDATE 1:
  The **main.py** is essentially a JSON CRUD API and I have also made files for system testing and functional testing using FastAPI.

  
#UPDATE 2:
  For returning structured responses(i.e json), I first made a simple ML model which i can send data through the API endpoint for prediction and obtain the output. Funneling the output as a json response. That   is the **sentiment_api.py** file and the requests as well as the responses are written in the **struct_senti.py file**.
